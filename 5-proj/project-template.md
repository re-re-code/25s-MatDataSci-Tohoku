# Guides for Writing your report

For the full document:

* you can use a html output but you need to keep the sectioning
* You are writing a comprehensive report
* The goal is to communicate to others
* Need to focus on communicating
* There should be no code or text not in the appropriate headings below
* Delete/comment out extra notes (like these) or others so your document is as clear as it can be
* Reference your figures, tables, equations in the document.
* Captions are needed on all figures, tables, and equations.
* Think about your audience and clearly communicating.

For the updates:

* please include the previous update for each Submitted Update Document
    + Each update is important to keep for grading
* For the final report remove updates and give a full comprehensive report
* Delete or comment out my notes that you are not using when you submit your documents
    + The extra clutter makes communication difficult


# Update 2

* Please put a bulleted list of things you have accomplished since the last update
  + Include things that didn't work but you tried
  + Things you are planning on doing
  + Questions that you might have on your project.
* Reference the sections and figures you are dicussing here

# Update 1

* Please put a bulleted list of things you have accomplished since the last update
  + Include things that didn't work but you tried
  + Things you are planning on doing
  + Questions that you might have on your project.
* Reference the sections and figures you are dicussing here

# Excuetive Summary
  
* Summarize the key (This could be a bulleted list)
  + information about your data set
  + major data cleaning
  + findings from EDA
  + Model output
  + Overall conclusions

# Abstract

* Summary of the nature, finding and meaning of your data analysis project. 
* 1 paragraph written summary of your data analysis project
   
# Introduction

* Background and motivation of the Data Science question. The ``Why'' of the research
* Explanation of your data
  + Where is your data from
  + What are the variables
* What data would be necessary to improve your analysis?
   
# Data Science Methods

* To be applied (such as image processing, time-series analysis, spectral analysis etc)
* Define critical capabilities and identify packages you will draw upon

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Explanation of your data set

* How many variables?
* What are the data classes?
* How many levels of factors for factor variables?
* Is your data suitable for a project analysis?
* Write you databook, defining variables, units and structures

## Data Cleaning

* What you had to do to clean your data

## Data Vizualizations

* Vizualizations of your data

## Variable Correlations

* Pairwise correlation plots, etc.
  
# Statistical Learning: Modeling \& Prediction

*  least 1 simple linear model (or simple logistic model)
* requires the appropriate modeling for your data set including machine learning

* Types of modeling to try
* Statistical prediction/modeling
* Model selection
* Cross-validation, Predictive R2
* Interpret results
* Challenge results
   
# Discussion

* Discussion of the answers to the data science questions framed in the introduction
  
# Conclusions
   
# Acknowledgments
   
# References

* Include a bib file in the markdown report
* Or hand written citations.
