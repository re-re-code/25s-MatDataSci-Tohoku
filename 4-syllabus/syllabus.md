## Grading Scale
* 0–59: Fail
* 60–69: C
* 70–79: B
* 80–89: A
* 90–100: AA

 The course is graded on a 100-point basis
* Two Assignments = 10 points each = 20 pts
* Two Project Updates (oral presentations) =  10 pts each = 30 pts 
* Final Report (including oral presentation) = 30 pts
* **Total** = 100 pts
- Grading is done on a curve. We will report the mean and standard deviation of Lab Exercises and Exam.
- All Lab Exercise assignments are submitted electronically by Midnight on the day they are due.
- Late submission of Lab Exercises will result in loss of 1 point for each day they are late.
